Excited to share my AI project: “ReqMaster AI”, an intelligent chatbot!

I developed ReqMaster AI, a chatbot that acts as a software requirements engineer, making requirement gathering faster and easier. It interacts with clients like a real engineer, asking structured questions about the software they want and its functionalities. Based on the conversation, it elicits all requirements and categorizes them into functional, non-functional, and domain-specific requirements.

Key Features:

Multi-modal input: Text, voice, and file uploads

4-stage conversation: Introduction → Feature Discovery → Technical Exploration → Finalization

AI-powered requirement extraction with automated risk analysis

Editable requirements before final export

Professional documentation: IEEE SRS templates, Word File , PDF

diagrams generator: use case, class, sequence, flowchart, feature tree, context diagram, erd diagram

Built with React & Tailwind CSS, this chatbot demonstrates how AI can streamline software development and improve collaboration between clients and developers.
